        How to Write an About Us Page
        The best About Us pages share the company and founders’ stories. It’s a chance to pull back the curtain on the business and showcase the people who make it happen.
        
        Some of the most effective About Us pages:
        
        Connect the consumer to the business on a deeper level
        Provide contextual insight into why the founders created the business
        Share the business’s core values, mission, beliefs, and vision
        Answer any questions that consumers may have about the business
        The About Us page is an important element of your business website
        The About Us page is a vital element of your business website.
        How can you accomplish those objectives through your About Us page? First, let’s look at a commonly-used About Us page template that drives success.
        
        About Us Page Template
        There are four main components to an About Us page:
        
        1. Share the story of why the company was founded
        
        This is your chance to focus on your company’s “why.” It could be what sets you apart from other competitors on the market.
        
        Share the moment you gained the inspiration for your business and what motivated you to start it.
        
        2. Highlight your background and your founding team’s role
        
        Who are you? Why are you the right person to lead your company at this time? Share your background and personal story. That’ll connect you to your customers.
        
        3. Document the evolution of the company
        
        State everything from the obstacles to the product enhancements. Bring your new customers up to speed. Where is the company today? How is it different from where it was before?
        
        4. Document the mission and vision
        
        What is your company trying to solve? Where is it going? End the About Us page by detailing the steps you’re taking to transform the business into your ultimate vision.
        
        With these four components, you’ll create a stellar About Us page that will wow prospects and convert new customers.
        
        Combining these elements with the right website builder and proper page design will help you transform a visitor into a customer.
        
        It’s important to remember what your customers want, too.
        
        Users in your target audience want to see your mission statement, social proof, and an example of using your product. These elements on your About Us web page will build trust with the target audience.
        
        Now, let’s look at some companies that championed those components and brought them to life.
        
        30 About Us Page Examples (by Industry)
        No matter what industry you’re in, you could use an About Us page on your site.
        
        While the four components listed above are necessary for every About Us page, different industries sometimes take different approaches.
        
        Below, you’ll find 30 of the best About Us pages categorized by industry. Learn from their successes and adapt some of their strategies when creating your own.
        
        
        Buffer
        Buffer has an About Us page that focuses on its stellar team
        Buffer About Us page.
        Buffer’s About Us page focuses on the team behind the tech. A catchy headline doesn’t greet you as you click onto the page. Instead, you see a photo of Buffer‘s team members who contribute to creating its product.
        
        This is a great way to shine a line on the entire organization and embody a truly collaborative mindset. Instead of focusing solely on the founders, businesses can highlight the team that powers the product daily and makes the magic happen.
        
        Vidyard
        Vidyard uses its About Us page to highlight the core functions of its product
        Vidyard About Us page
        Vidyard’s About Us page leads with a headline highlighting its mission and flows directly into the core functions of its product. The page has a product demo video that you’ll stumble across as you stroll, revealing additional use cases. Finally, the leadership team is featured.
        
        This high-level approach to an About Us page places the primary focus on the products’ benefits with a secondary focus on the team. If your product is complex, this may be an approach that you should consider.
        
        Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) Industry
        RXBAR, The Sill, and Hydrant are three examples of consumer-packaged goods (CPG) companies that effectively use an About Us page to tell their stories.
        
        RXBAR
        RXBAR shares the company story on its About Us page.
        RXBAR About Us page.
        RXBAR positions its About Us page around the company’s history, dating back to 2013. The bold headline draws the reader in by highlighting the company’s conception.
        
        “It’s 2013, and we called B.S. on protein bars,” it says.
        
        The reader continues to discover more about the brand and the company’s evolution with a “Then and Now” slider. A slider is an excellent multimedia option to consider. It takes the consumer through your company’s history without taking up too much space on the page.
        
        The Sill
        The Sill uses its About Us page to connect deeper with customers.
        The Sill About Us page.
        The Sill, a direct-to-consumer plant company, has a simple but effective About Us page. It focuses mainly on the company’s origin story, highlighting basic facts about its founders and evolution. Then, it invites consumers to apply for an open role.
        
        This is effective because it’s simple and straight to the point. It shows that About Us pages don’t have to be packed with information. Instead, you can straightforwardly introduce yourself and your company and still effectively get your point across.
        
        
        Bird’s values are the stars of its About Us page.
        Bird About Us page.
        Bird’s About Us page is structured around the company’s core values. Bird outlines its values by creating a unique icon that corresponds with each pillar of the company.
        
        The use of iconography on your About Us page is an effective strategy. Distinct icons can be memorable and help break down the text into bite-sized ideas.
        
        Music
        Spotify, Mighty Audio, and WaveXR have unique About Us pages as leading music tech companies.
        
        Spotify
        Only essential information is found on Spotify’s About Us page.
        Spotify About Us page.
        Spotify’s About Us page consists of only text and no images. Most of the content on this page is addresses, customer service emails, and a brief company description.
        
        Spotify’s direct approach on its About Us page shows that you can just include the basics or core company information, as long as you’re a global, world-renowned brand.
        
        Mighty Audio
        Mighty Audio introduces you to its team on its About Us page.
        Mighty Audio About Us page.
        Mighty Audio shares its story with two chunks of block text before highlighting the team on its About Us page. The contrast of a dark background and the light blue header text pops.
        
        Consider how you can involve contrasting colors on your page to ensure that the most important information stands out.
        
        WaveXR
        Navigation bars help spread out information on WaveXR’s About Us page.
        WaveXR About Us page.
        WaveXR divides its About Us page into four distinct parts: the team, values, careers, and press. The page opens with a brief company description and then invites the reader to click on one of those four subheads to learn more.
        
        It is always a good idea to include press mentions on your About Us page. Press can help build social proof and boost the credibility of your business. Consumers can learn about your company through any relevant news stories you receive.
        
        Billing
        Chargebee, ReCharge, and Cedar are prime examples of adequate About Us pages in the billing space.
